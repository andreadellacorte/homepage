## How to use

You can run it locally or use [the one hosted at GitHub Pages](https://pauloo27.github.io/homepage).

### Recommended wallpapers

By default homepage has 2 wallpapers, the `day wallpaper` that is used from 6 am until 6 pm and a 
`night wallpaper` that used from 6 pm until 6 am. You can customize and set your own background to it.
You can find dynamic wallpapers at https://dynamicwallpaper.club.

Here are some good looking ones:

## How to run it locally

First, make sure you have NodeJS and Yarn installed, then clone the repository.

To install all the dependencies, in the repository folder run:

> yarn install

After that, start the application with hot reload with:

> yarn start

To get a better performance, create a production build with

> yarn build

(the folder `build/` will be created, just add it to a web server).

### Configure Google Calendar Integration

To use the Google Calendar integration locally you need to configure the credentials.

To do so, create a new project and enable the Calendar API in the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
and get an API KEY and the CLIENT ID ([like this](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/js)).

With the CLIENT ID and the API KEY, create a file `src/config/gapi.json` with the following content:

```json
{"apiKey": "YOUR API KEY", "clientId": "YOUR CLIENT ID"}
```
